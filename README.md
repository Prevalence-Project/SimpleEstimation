# Bayesian Model Simple Estimation Steps
Bayesian information synthesis begins with the assumption that there are multiple data sources that all provide partial information about out parameters of interest. Here we show the stip-by-step of the simple estimation on how we linked data sources through equations in order to estimate OUD prevalence and untreated OUD in New York State at county level. The output of these calculations were used to create our Bayesian model to make such estimations.
